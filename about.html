<p>I graduated from Ole Miss in 2016 with a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering. Upon graduation, I accepted a position at Curtsy as the Lead Marketer. Living in Silicon Valley, I quickly learned I wanted to understand computers... so there you have it, I'm well on my way to becoming a Full Stack Web Developer. </p>
