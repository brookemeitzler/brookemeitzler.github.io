A chemical engineer major now Lead Marketer at Curtsy– a fashion forward app based in Silicon Valley who now wants to learn to code. One might think the three do not go together, but in my opinion, they match perfectly. I’ll tell you why: I’m not your stereotype.

Since my early years, I have always had a strong way of expressing myself through my swift problem solving and design skills. I took a leap of independence when I went to boarding school for my last two years of high school. Although I did not know a soul at the school, I embraced the culture and excelled. This was when I truly began my journey of originality, spontaneity, creativity, and simply figuring things out on my own. 

From the Mississippi School for Mathematics and Science, I decided to attend the University of Mississippi. While at the University of Mississippi, I studied chemical engineering. Because of this dry curriculum, I was forced to indulge in outlets that I am passionate about. Since I have always had a love for design and engineering, I decided to continue my creative strategies and formed a company with my best friend called Engineered Dreams. 

Engineered Dreams specialized in personalized cake toppers, cards, and decorations. I drew mock designs of our products in Adobe Illustrator and cut them on a Silhouette Cameo. I yearn for the projects that seem impossible, then finding a way to execute them, bring them to life, and make them become realiity. 

Along with Engineered Dreams, I was the website coordinator and Vice President of Public Relations for my sorority, Tri Delta. During these two positions, I controlled the public image for our sorority among all social media platforms, including our website and blog I created and maintained. Any time any member or friend needed assistance for a creative or design project, I loved being the person people came to for assistance (and the majority of time– completion.)

Because my passion for graphic design and brand marketing is so evident, I was selected to be an intern at Mary Kay Cosmetics’ headquarters in Addison, TX. Over 3,000 applicants applied for this program and under 3% of these young professionals were extended an offer. At Mary Kay, I was responsible for the creative direction of social media, as well as conceptualizing and designing original marketing content based on the brand style to support global product. 

Upon completion of this internship, I accepted the role as the Marketing Lead for Curtsy. While here, I have published over 100 blog posts, manage 45 Instagram accounts and roles, and design all email campaigns sent to our users.

The only thing missing amongst my skill level is the ability to code. 

I applied for the Flatiron School's Birchbox Woman Take Tech Scholarship in April and recently was notified that I was one of the 30 recipients chosen for this opportunity. I'm beyond ecstatic to be a part of the Full Stack Web Developer program. Upon completion of this program, I plan to assist in building a web app for our Curtsy users.

Being an extremely hard-headed and determined young woman, the ability to code has always been a skill set I have craved. Knowing how things work has been my life motto since I was a child. I can't wait to bring you along with me on the journey this year.
