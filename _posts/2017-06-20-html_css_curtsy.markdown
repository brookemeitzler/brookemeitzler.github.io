This past week our Curtsy team decided to bring our blog back. Although this sounds like an easy decision, it required hours of planning and ongoing work. From redesigning the layout of the blog to onboarding our campus team members who will be contributing to our blog, it's been a rigorous journey.

In the light of all of the tedious tasks that is associated with our blog, I was delighted to see such enthusiasm about HTML from one of our campus directors. To see who was interested in contributing to our blog, I sent an email to all of our campus team members at all 35 schools. I received numerous replies, but one stood out from the rest.

> Hey hey Brooke!

> Let's bring the blog back!! I’d love write the blog for UK’s campus! We already have a stellar team of girls and the blog will simply attract a ton of new girls that will create just the buzz about Curtsy we’re looking for. From what I have researched, Wordpress blogs are easy to manage, both in terms of maintenance and from a viewer’s perspective of managing the content on the site - plus it's really a simple tool to learn and I’d love to become a master of it. Let me know what ya think!

I immediately responded to Kelly and hopped on a Facetime with her! I was ecstatic to see her excitement about learning HTML. After we discussing why we decided to bring our blog back and a few fundamentals of Wordpress, we dove into the fun of blogging—HTML. 

Like every Facetime meeting about the blog, I showed Kelly a few steps on creating a blog post and the difference between the 'visual' and 'text' tab.

As soon as I pressed on the 'text' tab together, her face lit up with joy!

She told me everything was coming back to her when I put `<strong>paragraph</strong>` in the 'text' tab then instantly switched back to the 'visual' tab to see: **paragraph**.

This was the first time to see someone else as excited about learning HTML as I was for the first time, and it felt like I unlocked a new world for her again. I'm so excited to see what Kelly brings to the table next.
